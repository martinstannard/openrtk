# openrtk

OpenCode plugin for [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) (Rust Token Killer). Reduces LLM token consumption by 60-90% on common dev commands by transparently routing them through RTK's output compression.

A lightweight OpenCode plugin that intercepts shell commands and pipes them through RTK for automatic output compression. The model sees full output while RTK handles token reduction behind the scenes — no changes needed to prompts or workflow.

## Prerequisites

Install RTK:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk
```

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install openrtk
```

Then add to your OpenCode config (`opencode.json` or `.opencode/config.json`):

```json
{
  "plugin": ["openrtk"]
}
```

Or copy `src/index.ts` directly into `.opencode/plugins/` for local use.

## How it works

The plugin hooks into OpenCode's `tool.execute.before` event and rewrites shell commands to go through RTK before execution. This is fully transparent to the model.

```
git status       ->  rtk git status       (72% savings)
cargo test       ->  rtk cargo test       (80% savings)
docker ps        ->  rtk docker ps        (65% savings)
```
